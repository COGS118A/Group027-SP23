    "# Abstract \n",
    "For our project we are aiming to create a model that can help estimate the price of a home based on a list of criteria. From our background research we have seen that with rapidly increasing home prices, many people are struggling to find homes that fit in their criteria and also fit their budget. We have a large dataset that contains 1000 observations of past housing prices with 18 separate variables. Some of the variables are the number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and zip code. This past data also contains the price for houses in these criteria allowing us too create a classifier. We also are aiming through this process to identify the variables that are most influential in the price/prediction. In order to evaluate the data we will split the data on a training/testing set where we compare our models prediction compared to the actual price of the home with the given criteria."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed some research on the trends of home ownership prices and also performed some research on why it is an important topic. Homeownership is a longtime stable of the American economy and Article 1 below explains “78% of Americans still associate homeownership with the ‘American Dream’”<a name=\"kcmcrew\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#kcmnote). The financial independence of being able to claim ownership of where you live is extremely important, but despite this desire, according to Article 2 below “Since just 2000, home prices have grown 121% faster than the cost of general goods” <a name=\"candiloro\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#candiloronote) People are struggling to purchase homes which is why this is a problem we want to tackle with a model. Utilizing a wide variety of criteria we aim to be able to predict the price of a home based on data to help people to see if homes are within their budget. Article 3 below says “Nearly 30 million Americans plan to buy a home in 2023” and our model will help these people understand the market and how specific criteria influence home prices <a name=\"vise\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#visenote)."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Ever since 2000, there has been a rapid increase in house prices in the United States. Because of this, we've seen an all-time high on the number of Americans who are unable to afford houses. However, with the amount of things simultaneously going on in the world, it is unclear what variables are causing this change. To address this issue, we intend to use a machine-learning model such as SVMs or Logistic Regression to predict the house price based on its attributes like size, number of bed/bathrooms, number of stories, and a few others. We can quantify this problem by thinking of the house price as a function of the combination of its attributes. We can also measure the severity of this problem by the relationship between house prices and the number of people who cannot afford them. This is of course a recurring problem because there has been a consistent rise in house prices every year for the past two decades which allows us to collect even more data over time."

Some critical variables could be the square feet and price which are both represented as integers in this dataset. Thankfully, the dataset is pretty clean to start off with, so there may not be many heavy changes that need to be made to the dataset."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to use independent variables like the number of bedrooms and construction date in an effort to predict the final price of the house. This means that we should start with EDA as well as feature selection so that we can narrow down from the 17 independent variables that we’re starting off with. As for actually predicting the price we can use SVMs to accomplish this. Once we split the dataset into training and testing sets we can train the SVM on the training set such that it tries to minimize its errors. Of course, once we have a trained model we can test it on the test set and take note of its performance through tools like MSE. Then we can use tools like Grid Search to try and finetune our parameters such that we can optimize the overall model. Once, we’ve finished those steps we can finally deploy our model on unseen data and measure how well it performs. We feel this solution can work because SVMs are well suited for predicting continuous variables and it will be fed with the variables that we feel are the most important in predicting the price. This means that the model will be built upon the most quality data available to us instead of basing it on more unreliable variables. The most straightforward way we can test our model will be against the test set that we split at the beginning. This will allow us to gain a glimpse into how effective our model is against data that it wasn’t explicitly built on without requiring us to find another similar dataset."
